🚀 QEMU: Open Source VM optimized in assembler!

Compiled and automated with MSYS2 — the developer’s Swiss army knife
🔧 Recently, I created a bash script for MSYS2/Windows that fully automates downloading, configuring, and compiling QEMU, with real assembler (NASM) optimizations and advanced build options.

QEMU is one of the most fascinating open source projects for anyone working in virtualization, emulation, embedded systems, or kernel hacking. But when it's built and tuned properly, it can deliver remarkable performance improvements ⚡ over default binaries.

Here’s what the script does:

📅 Downloads the latest stable QEMU version from qemu.org
 💪 Compiles for Windows 64-bit using NASM with aggressive optimization flags
 📐 Optionally injects CACHE_ALIGN (64-byte) alignment in header files
 🔄 Enables VirtFS support with a simple --virtfs flag
 📁 Creates a ready-to-use .tar.gz package

💡 MSYS2 is a hidden gem: a powerful development environment where you can build everything from system software to video games, Android apps, or even web backends and much more..
 With a bit of shell scripting, it becomes a full stack development environment on Windows.

⚠️ Warning: This is not beginner-friendly!
 The script targets developers with solid experience in shell scripting, compilers, low-level optimizations, and POSIX-like environments on Windows.

🔥 Put the boost into your applications!
 Enough with copy-paste coding — embrace the “Pure Metal Code” philosophy and the results will be nothing short of extraordinary.
